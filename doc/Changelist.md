-	Brought in shapefiles for PR, DR, BVI, USVI. Extracted the first 5 raster values (Reef Crest, Fore Reef, Back Reef, Coral/Algae, and Spur and Groove Reef). According to Supplementary Material from Schill et al. (2021) in Remote Sensing. Some coral are in the Hardbottom Algae areas, as well as in Seagrass and Boulders and Rocks, however including these layers would have vastly overestimated shallow coral coverage since corals are generally quite sparse in these areas.
-	Methods:
o	Extract only raster values I want, to a new raster (https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/49800/extracting-raster-values-and-creating-new-raster-in-qgis)
o	Polygonize that raster (now “reefs” are 1s and everything else is 0s)
o	Extract just the 1s to a new polygon (Extract by Attributes) (https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/93237/eliminate-0-values-from-raster)

Update 26 Sep 2024:
Freaked out after MacOS Sequoia update broke some things in my spatial R set-up, so I uninstalled MacPorts and QGIS completely.
This may not have been smart.
Once it is (hopefully) sucessfully reinstalled on the new OS, which has some dependency issues with MacPorts (and MacPorts is required
to have access to the newest GDAL versions, so I can't avoid using it to properly load geodatabases), I may have to set up all my preferences
in QGIS again. This includes the plug-in that loaded stuff like NOAA /ESRI ocean basebamps, and also the benthic terrain modeler plug-in
