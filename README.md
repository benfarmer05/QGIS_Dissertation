August 2024: My dissertation's GIS inputs and outputs are now organized and mirrored to the cloud (Google Drive). The archive section contains files dating back to 2020/2021 when I began my dissertation, and can successively be cleaned up as things are no longer needed for reference. This repository will hold all Python scripts developed to automatic inputs/outputs through QGIS. Note that this process of scripting only began in 2024 (present markdown), so unfortunately not all of my workflow to create this project will be easily reproducible. The repo only holds scripts and documentation; anyone needing the (large) input/output spatial files, please reach out! Eventually I will work to have these hosted somewhere if possible. Additionally, I may merge this repo with my Chapter 2 / Chapter 3 repo's eventually.
